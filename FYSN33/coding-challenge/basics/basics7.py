# Basics 7: Smallest distance
# You are given an input file (basics7.txt) with two columns of numbers, separated by whitespace.
# Write a program that reads the two columns of numbers, and pairs up the two smallest numbers, 
# the two next-smallest numbers etc., up to the two largest numbers. Calculate the distance between
# each pair, and print out the sum of all distances.
