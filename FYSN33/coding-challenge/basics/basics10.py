# Basics 10: write a report in a file
# Write a program that creates a file called
# report.txt. The contents of the file should
# be:
# New report
# the natural logarithm of the number 5 with
# floating point precision.
# Both on separate lines.
# You can use the numpy library.
# If succesful, the program should exit
# with status code 0.

import numpy as np

def report(filename):
    # TODO: Implement this function
    return # Replace with your implementation

if __name__ == "__main__":
    report("report.txt")
    # TODO: Implement the exit
