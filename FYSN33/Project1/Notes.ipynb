    "\n",
    "### Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SPH method we use the following key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The problem domain is represented by a set of arbitrarily distributed particles and no connectivity of the particles is needed (i.e. meshfree).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We use an integral representation for the field functions and introduce a kernel approximations. It provides stability and has a smoothing effect\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The kernel approximation is then further approximated using particles. This is known asa the particle approximation in SPH\n",
    "    - Done by replacing the integral representation of the functions and its derivatives with summation over all corresponding values at the neighbouring particles in a local domain called the support domain (compact support)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```math \n",
    "    W(|x_i-x_j|,h)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Results in banded sparse matrices which can be solved efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The particle approx is performed at each time step, so particles depend on the current local distrib of particles (adaptive). Therefore, SPH naturally handles problems with large deformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The support domain must be sufficiently large and particles can be assigned mass and become physical material particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The particle approximations are performed on all field functions to produce a set of ODE's in discretised form with respecti to time only (Lagrangian). Such equations are conceptually simpler than the Eulerian equvalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. The ODE's are solved using an integration algorithm to achieve fast time stepping, and to obtain the time history of all the field variables for all the particles (dynamic).\n",
    "\n",
    "So our dynamical problem is meshfree, adaptive, stable and Lagrangian.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed formulation follows below.\n",
